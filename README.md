## Installation

To start using the algorithms in this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MahmoudHanyFathalla/Computing-Algorithms.git
```

You can run the individual algorithm scripts directly or integrate them into your own projects.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python script. For example, to run a sorting algorithm:

```bash
python sorting/quick_sort.py
```

Feel free to modify and adapt the code as needed for your own use cases.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you'd like to add an algorithm, improve an existing one, or provide feedback, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and create a pull request.
